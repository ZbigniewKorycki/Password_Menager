<h1>Password Manager</h1>

This is a simple password manager application built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows you to generate strong passwords, save them along with website and email information, and retrieve them when needed.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 29.
